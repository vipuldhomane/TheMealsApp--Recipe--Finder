##Features (No need for extra features, just make the listed features)

###Home Page
Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).

Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list).

On clicking any particular search result (any meal), open a new page with more information about that meal(meal page)

###Meal Detail Page

Should show information about the meal like its name, photo, instructions, etc (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

###My favourite meals Page

Display a list of all the favourite meals.
Make this list persistent (should have the same number of meals before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).

Remove from favourites button: Each meal should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that meal from the list.
